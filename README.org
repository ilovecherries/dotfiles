this is where i keep all of my configuration files i suppose

* Emacs
text editor

* Kitty
terminal emulator. i kind of want to transition from using kitty but this is
what i happen to be using ta the moment

* Pulse
contains settings for my pulse equalizer settings since my headphones do not
have a lot of bass.
