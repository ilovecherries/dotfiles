#+TITLE: PulseAudio Equalizer Presets
#+AUTHOR: Cherry

because pulseaudio equalizer sucks, it won't display saved presets in its list for
some reason even when manually modifying the preset list. so to apply one of the
equalizer settings, just use `cp` to overwrite the current `equalizerrc` file.

* Steelseries
these motherfuckers have such overbearing mids and highs, holy shit. they're
comfy though.

* L440
this probably looks random, but idk it just sounds good especially since i
typically have a fan running whenever im using my laptop
